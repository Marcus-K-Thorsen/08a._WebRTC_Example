## How to Use the Application

1. **Go to the Application URL**  
   Both you and the person you want to call should open the application in your web browsers by visiting the URL where it is hosted.

2. **Start Your Webcam**  
   - Press the **Start webcam** button.  
   - Your browser will ask for permission to use your webcam and microphone. Click **Allow** to proceed.  
   - You should now see your video feed under "Local Stream."

3. **Create a Call (Caller)**  
   - The person initiating the call (the caller) should press the **Create Call (offer)** button.  
   - A unique code will appear in the input field under "Join a Call."  
   - Copy this code and share it with the person you want to call.

4. **Join a Call (Receiver)**  
   - The person receiving the call (the receiver) should paste the code they received into the input field under "Join a Call."  
   - Then, press the **Answer** button.  
   - A video connection will be established, and both parties should now see and hear each other.

5. **End the Call**  
   - Either party can press the **Hangup** button to end the call.  
   - After hanging up, you can restart the process to call someone else.

## Creating Firebase Hosting

### 1. Install Firebase CLI

Before proceeding, check if the Firebase CLI is already installed globally:
```sh
firebase --version
```

- If the command returns a version number, skip the next step.
- If the command is not recognized, install the Firebase CLI globally:
  ```sh
  npm install -g firebase-tools
  ```

### 2. Log in to Firebase

Log in to your Firebase account using your Google credentials:
```sh
firebase login
```

### 3. Initialize Firebase Hosting

Set up Firebase Hosting for your project:
```sh
firebase init hosting
```

During the setup:
- Select **"Use an existing project"** and choose your Firebase project (`webrtc-video-chat-c70ec`).
- Set the **public directory** to `dist`.
- Choose **"Yes"** for single-page app configuration.
- Skip setting up automatic builds and deploys with GitHub for now.

## Build and Deploy

1. **Build the project**  
   Run the following command to create a production-ready build of the project:
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```
   This will generate a `dist` folder containing all the files needed to run the project.

2. **Deploy to Firebase Hosting**  
   Deploy the project to Firebase Hosting using:
   ```sh
   firebase deploy
   ```
   After deployment, your project will be live at the hosting URL provided by Firebase.
